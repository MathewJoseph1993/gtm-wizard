# GTM Wizard Pricing Model

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 29, 2025
**Status:** Approved

---

## Core Principle

> **Self-hosted is FREE forever. Cloud is affordable convenience.**

We believe in open source. The code is MIT licensed. Anyone can run GTM Wizard on their own infrastructure at no cost. Cloud hosting is for those who prefer convenience over self-management.

```

### Pricing Rationale
**$5-10/month** is:
- **Impulse purchase territory** - Low barrier to try
- **Covers infrastructure costs** - Sustainable for us
- **Respects open source** - Not a "gotcha" premium tier

---

## Why BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)?

We don't markup AI costs. You pay your AI provider directly.

**Benefits:**
- **Transparency:** You see exactly what AI costs
- **No vendor lock-in:** Switch providers anytime
- **Control:** Use local Ollama for zero external cost
- **Privacy:** Your AI conversations don't go through us

**Typical AI costs:**
| Provider | Model | Approx. Cost |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| OpenAI | GPT-4 | ~$0.03/query |
| OpenAI | GPT-3.5 | ~$0.002/query |
| Anthropic | Claude | ~$0.015/query |
| Ollama | Local | $0 |

At ~100 analyses/month: **$0.20 - $3.00/month** for AI.

## No Free Tier (For Cloud)

Research shows freemium conversion is only 3.7%. We'd rather:
- Keep self-hosted 100% free (true open source)
- Make cloud affordable ($5-10) instead of free-with-limits

This is the pattern used by successful open-source companies:
- **Plausible:** Self-host free, cloud from $9/mo
- **Cal.com:** Self-host free, cloud from $15/mo
- **n8n:** Self-host free, cloud from $20/mo

---

## Future Pricing Considerations

### Potential Add-ons (Not Planned Yet)
- **Team features:** Multiple users, shared workspace
- **Priority support:** Faster response times
- **Custom integrations:** Dedicated tool connections
- **White-label:** Remove GTM Wizard branding

### What Will Always Be Free
- Core functionality
- All tool integrations
- AI coaching features
- Self-hosted deployment
- Community support

---

## Sustainability Model

```
Revenue Sources:
├── Cloud subscriptions ($5-10/mo × users)
├── GitHub Sponsors (community support)
├── Grants (OSS programs)
└── Future: Enterprise/team features

Costs:
├── Infrastructure (servers, database)
├── Development time
└── Support overhead

Goal: Cloud revenue covers infrastructure + enables ongoing development
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why is self-hosted completely free?**
A: We believe in open source. If you have the technical ability to run it yourself, you shouldn't have to pay.

**Q: Will cloud get more expensive later?**
A: We commit to keeping cloud affordable ($5-10 range). No bait-and-switch.

**Q: What if I start self-hosted and want to move to cloud?**
A: Easy migration path. Export data, import to cloud.

**Q: Do you use my data for training?**
A: No. Your data is yours. We don't use customer data for AI training.

**Q: What happens if GTM Wizard shuts down?**
A: The code is open source. Self-hosted users continue unaffected. Cloud users can export and self-host.

**Status:** Approved

## One-Line Vision

> **GTM Wizard: The open-source AI-powered GTM operating system for solo founders.**

---

## The Problem We Solve

Solo technical founders building B2B SaaS face a fundamental conflict:

- They're **builders** by identity, but the market demands they become **sellers**
- They have the intelligence to succeed, but lack **confidence** that they're on the right track
- They abandon proven channels too early, drawing **wrong lessons** from insufficient data
- They operate in isolation, with no one to tell them "you're doing fine, keep going"

**The research (450+ sources) validated one core insight:**

> **"Founders don't need more speed or automation. They need CONFIDENCE + CLARITY."**

---

## Our Solution

GTM Wizard is an **open-source AI-powered GTM operating system** that:

1. **Connects to your existing tools** (Instantly, Apollo, CRM, etc.)
2. **Analyzes your GTM activity** using research-backed expertise
3. **Tells you if you're on track** with clear signals (RED/YELLOW/GREEN)
4. **Coaches you through the hard parts** (especially the "Day 21" persistence gap)
5. **Remembers your context** so advice is personalized to your journey

## What Makes Us Different

| Current Solutions | GTM Wizard |
|-------------------|------------|
| Sell speed ("send more emails") | Sell confidence ("you're on track") |
| Black box AI (no transparency) | Open source (see everything) |
| Expensive ($299-5,000/mo) | Free self-hosted, $5-10/mo cloud |
| Vendor lock-in | BYOK (Bring Your Own AI Key) |
| One-size-fits-all | Context-aware, remembers your journey |

---

## The Market Gap

The market is bifurcated:

- **Commoditized Volume** ($37-150/mo): Apollo, Instantly, Smartlead
  - They help you send more, but don't tell you if it's working

- **Hyper-Intelligence** ($500-5,000/mo): Clay, AI SDRs
  - Complex, steep learning curve, expensive

**The missing middle:** A "Confidence + Clarity" layer that's accessible, transparent, and actually helps founders persist until breakthrough.

---

## Who We Serve

**Primary:** Solo Technical Founders with Early Traction ($1-5K MRR)

- Have proven product-market fit (someone is paying)
- Need to scale customer acquisition
- Technical enough to self-host, or willing to pay $5-10/mo for convenience
- Want transparency and control over their GTM data

**Secondary (future):**
- Pre-revenue founders
- Growing founders ($5-20K MRR)
- Seed-funded startups

## Our Principles

### 1. Open Source First
- All code on GitHub under MIT license
- Self-hosting is always free
- No feature gating between free and paid

### 2. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)
- Users connect their own AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- No vendor lock-in
- Users control their costs

### 3. Research-Backed
- Every feature informed by 450+ sources of market research
- We build what founders actually need, not what sounds impressive

### 4. Confidence Over Speed
- We don't help you send more emails
- We help you know if your approach is working

### 5. Memory Matters
- The AI remembers your context
- Advice improves over time as we learn your patterns

## Success Metrics

We succeed when:

1. **Founders persist longer** - Fewer quit before Day 21 breakthrough
2. **Founders draw right lessons** - Wrong lesson formation decreases
3. **Founders feel confident** - Self-reported confidence increases
4. **Community grows** - GitHub stars, contributors, users
5. **Project is sustainable** - Cloud revenue covers development costs

## The Name

**GTM Wizard** = Go-To-Market Wizard

- "Wizard" implies expertise, guidance, a bit of magic
- Not "GTM Tool" (tools get abandoned)
- Not "GTM AI" (too generic)
- A wizard guides you through the journey

---

*This vision was developed through rigorous market research (450+ sources), strategic analysis, and deep consideration of the intersection between founder needs and open-source sustainability.*

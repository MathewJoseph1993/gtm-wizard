## Initial Principles (Hypothesis)

Based on early discussions:

1. **Complement, Don't Compete**
   - Work with existing tools, not against them
   - "We don't need enemies in business"

2. **Research Before Building**
   - Understand users before coding features
   - Data over assumptions

3. **Transparent by Default**
   - Open source foundation
   - Clear reasoning in outputs

4. **Long-term Patience**
   - Build sustainably, not for quick wins
   - Community over shortcuts

## Research Inputs Needed

- [ ] User feedback on what they value
- [ ] Competitive analysis (how do others operate?)
- [ ] Business model implications (what constraints does sustainability add?)

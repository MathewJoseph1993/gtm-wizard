## Purpose

Before rushing to build features, we're doing proper foundation work:
1. Research the market and understand user needs
2. Make informed decisions about form factor, target user, and business model
3. Document our reasoning for future reference
4. Build something people actually want

## Current Focus

**Phase: Research & Discovery**

We are currently:
- [ ] Conducting market research across multiple platforms
- [ ] Identifying target user segments
- [ ] Analyzing competitive landscape
- [ ] Exploring business model options
- [ ] Evaluating form factor (MCP vs SaaS vs hybrid)

## Key Questions We're Answering

1. **Who is our target user?** (Solo founders? SMB teams? Enterprise?)
2. **What's the right form factor?** (MCP-only? SaaS? Hybrid?)
3. **How do we sustain this?** (Open source? Open core? SaaS?)
4. **Where do we fit?** (Complement Clay/Apollo? New category?)
